I want to thank professor Paulo Portugal for his continuous availability  to provide me with the best and most informed feedback possible, during all stages of the project.
Even though getting feedback has not always been easy due to the full-remote work conditions that the CODIV-19 pandemic imposed, professor Paulo Portugal made sure that all interactions were used to the fullest of what was possible, every single time.

I would also like to thank my family for putting up with my working habits and routines while we were all working from home.
Sometimes it wasn't easy to reconcile work and personal life, but these were definitely times where everyone had to adapt to a new reality.
As such, I'm thankful for being able to  have my own time management and working habits, but I'm also thankful that my family advised me from overworking at certain times.

I want to dedicate this work to my good friend Ania who helped me get through some rough times on my personal life.
Sometimes life throws a curve ball at us and suddenly nothing seems to be going the right way.
But, eventually, things become easier to overcome, especially when one has a friend that motivates us and pushes us to do our best, no matter the circumstances.
