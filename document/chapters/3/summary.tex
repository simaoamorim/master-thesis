\section{Summary} \label{sec:sys-arch-summary}

In this chapter we have presented the proposed architecture of the practical demonstrator we have designed during the development phase of this thesis.
In \autoref{sec:requirements} we explored and explained the requirements we have defined as crucial for the success of the project.
In \autoref{sec:proposed-arch} we describe how the system is inteded to work on a conceptual basis, both from high-level and low-level points of view.
The latter was done by diving deep on how the system works in terms of hardware and software fronts, independently.
Last but not least, in \autoref{sec:experiments} we presented a set of conceptual experiments we planned on implementing for validation purposes, leaving important information about the core concept which is relevant for future works to develop more sophisticated and advanced experimental concepts.
