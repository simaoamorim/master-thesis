\section{Proposed architecture} \label{sec:proposed-arch}

By the end of the development phase, we created a system that fulfils all requirements described previously.
The system mimics a simplified DCS architecture by employing a simple master-slave configuration using an RTE network.

As explained in \autoref{subsec:local_remote}, using the local control topology, the master node will act as a motion controller, feeding the motor controller (the field device) with position/velocity references through the RTE network.
This one, in turn, will perform the necessary algorithm computations to achieve motor position/velocity control using the references provided by the master node and the feedback values it acquires from the motor's encoder.

When using the remote control topology, the master node will be responsible for all computations in the system.
The field device will act as a simple I/O interface to the motor, generating the waveform fed to the motor and acquiring and decoding the motor's speed and position.
The decoded position and velocity values are then sent to the master node as feedback variables and the motor output is received from it as an output variable.

Graphical representations of both these scenarios can be seen in \autoref{fig:local_control} and \autoref{fig:remote_control}, respectively.
