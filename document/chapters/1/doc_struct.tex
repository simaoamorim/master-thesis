\section{Document structure} \label{sec:doc-struct}

The present document intends to describe not only the concept of the proposed educational real-time network demonstrator, but also present all research and experiments performed to achieve the final solution. As such, the following chapters will disclose:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \autoref{chap:sota}: Current state of industrial real-time networks with examples given and some in-depth explanation of how they work, both from generic and specific perspectives;

	\item \autoref{chap:sys-arch}: Description of the final proposed solution for the demonstrator, with a top-to-bottom approach;

	\item \autoref{chap:impl}: Developed software and hardware, including research exercises;

	\item \autoref{chap:eval}: Fitness evaluation of the proposed solution with real-life experimental data analysis;

	\item \autoref{chap:concl}: Summary of the proposed solution and evaluation results as well as an analysis on possible future work.
\end{itemize}
