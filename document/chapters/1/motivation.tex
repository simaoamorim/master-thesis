As modern control systems evolve in complexity, providing automation students with adequate training on the technologies used today is vital to ensure their integration on the industry is as smooth as possible. Learning what benefits and disadvantages a certain component or system brings to the automation world allows the future engineers to make more informed decisions when designing new control systems.

With industrial automation systems continuously improving their connectivity to the digitized world, it becomes essential to give students first-hand contact with the technology. Keeping this purpose in mind, the course on Electrical and Computers Engineering at \Feup{} is expanding its curricular suite with a class on real-time industrial communication networks.
