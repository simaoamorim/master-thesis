\chapter{Implementation} \label{chap:impl}

After having presented the proposed system architecture we will now move forward to describing how the project implementation was performed, starting with the evolution of the initial concept and then going through the hardware and software implementations.

This chapter will include many technical details, especially during the software implementation explanations.
These will range from technical details about the components used to specific techniques used during the development process.
