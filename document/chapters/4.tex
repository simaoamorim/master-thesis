\chapter{Implementation} \label{chap:impl}

After having presented the proposed system architecture in \autoref{chap:sys-arch}, we will now move forward to describing how the project implementation was performed, starting with the evolution of the initial concept and then going through the hardware and software implementations.
After having done so, we will also explain the limitations and design choices that were known to limit the outcome, up to a certain degree.

These limitations were mainly due to lack of time to develop better alternatives as the entire project, to include such alternatives, would require more development time, or more developers working together on this project.
All of these were pondered and they were only left out or replaced by simpler versions after making sure they would only reduce user friendliness or not include advanced functionality not part of the scope of the original concept.
As the result of this project is intended to be a proof of concept, user friendliness was only an optional objetive, which eventually had to be left behind.
