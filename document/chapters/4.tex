\chapter{Implementation} \label{chap:impl}

After having presented the proposed system architecture in \autoref{chap:sys-arch}, we will now move forward to describing how the entire project implementation was performed, starting with the evolution of the initial concept and then going through the hardware and software implementations.
After having done so, we will also explain the limitations and design choices that were known to limit the outcome, up to a certain degree.
These were mainly due to lack of time to develop better alternatives as the entire project, to include such alternatives, would require more development time, or more developers working together on this project.
