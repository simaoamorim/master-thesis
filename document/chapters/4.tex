\chapter{Implementation} \label{chap:impl}

After having presented the proposed system architecture we will now move forward to describing how the project implementation was performed, starting with the evolution of the initial concept and then going through the hardware and software implementations.

This chapter will include very technical details especially during the software implementation explanaitions, so in order to have a good understanding of the implementation, basic knowledge of computer software is required.
