\chapter{Proposal evaluation} \label{chap:eval}
In this chapter we will present a practical experiment we conducted and the resulting data.
This will serve as a foundation for the evaluation of the designed system, by allowing us to verify which goals have been met and to which extent the project can be considered successful.

After having done so, we will also explain the limitations and design choices that were known to limit the outcome, up to a certain degree.
These limitations were mainly due to design choices and all of them were pondered from the beginning.
Certain features or components were only left out or replaced by simpler versions after making sure they would only reduce user friendliness or not include some advanced functionality to the system, not part of the scope of the original proposition.
As the result of this project is intended to be a proof of concept, additional features and user friendliness was only an optional objective.
