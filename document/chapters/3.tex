\chapter{System architecture} \label{chap:sys-arch}

In this chapter we will present the architecture that has been defined for the system.
During the course of this project's development phase, its architecture was continuously adapted as difficulties and possibilities emerged with the advancements made.

The following descriptions will reflect the final state of the proposed demonstrator, after several incremental iterations.
In relevant parts of this work, some comparisons will be made with the initial planned architecture to, not only demonstrate the iterative development process adopted but also to highlight some key aspects that benefited from this type of approach.

We will begin this chapter with an analysis of the requirements we should meet in order for the demonstrator to have certain characteristics, then present a detailed explanation of the actual proposed architecture, including the chosen hardware and software, finishing with a brief and non-exhaustive description of some conceptual experiments that could be possibly demonstrated on the proposed platform.
