\section{Software development} \label{sec:software-devel}
As we have explained previously, the slave device we are developing on this project needs some custom functionality that needs to be programmed.
The following sections will present and explain the algorithms and techniques used during development of each software component that compose the final control program.

The presentation of the several segments will mostly follow the order by which they were developed in order to better explain the programming logic and challenges we had to overcome during the process.

% Slave node software
% `- DFR0592 driver
% `- GPIO encoder 'driver'
% `- PID algorithm
% `- velocity/position calculation algorithm
% `- netHAT handler
% `- miscelaneous glue code
