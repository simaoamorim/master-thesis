\section{Summary} \label{sec:impl-summary}
This chapter focused almost exclusively on technical details of how the final solution was implemented.
Starting with the choice of hardware components, going through their assembly and then moving towards the complex and extensive software required to give the desired slave device all planned functionality.

Not only the good things have been explained but we have also expressed those we are aware could have been better implemented or designed.
Even though this project was developed during difficult times, especially from having been done entirely on a full-remote work basis, most of the things explained as weak spots were considered from the beginning.
Difficult times impose harder decisions and \emph{simplify} became the daily word of choice because, sometimes, \emph{less is much more}.
It's one thing to design simple systems, but it's a much harder thing to simplify complex systems and boil them down to their bare-bones.
