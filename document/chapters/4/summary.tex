\section{Summary} \label{sec:impl-summary}
This chapter focused almost exclusively on technical details of how the final solution was implemented.
Starting with the presentation of the overall concept, going through the choice of hardware components, their assembly and then moving towards the complex and extensive software required to give the desired slave device all planned functionality.

This project was developed during difficult times, especially from having been done entirely on a full-remote work basis.
Such difficult times impose harder decisions and, as a result, \emph{simplify} became the daily word of choice because, most of the time, \emph{less is much more}.
It's one thing to design simple systems, but it's a much harder thing to simplify complex systems and be able to boil them down to their bare-bones.
