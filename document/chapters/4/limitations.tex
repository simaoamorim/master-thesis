\section{Limitations} \label{sec:limitations}
In this section we will present the main limitation of the developed system, mainly in the software components.
Most of these limitations exist due to development choices and not due to any particular impediment from realising them.
The main reasons that led us to make such choices include, but are not limited to, the project development being done by a single person, limited development time and, most importantly, the fact that the entire project has been developed from a home environment during the Portuguese COVID-19 lock-downs in early 2021.

% Hardware
\subsection{Hardware}
For the most part, the hardware components were chosen in a way they would not pose a big obstacle to the development of more advanced demonstration concepts.
Regardless, the designed and 3D-printed motor support was mostly meant to allow the motor to function properly without the user having to hold on to it.

This was one of the limitations that rose from developing the project from a home environment, where the development of the 3D model had to be done in an open-loop situation, without any feedback or preliminary testing before sending the complete design for production.
Ultimately this meant one of the 3D printed pieces was defective but, luckily, the problem was lessened with some hot glue, as seen in \autoref{fig:hotglue-support} (page \pageref{fig:hotglue-support}).

\end{figure}

Another hardware aspect that could be considered a limitation is the small encoder resolution (12 PPR).
This has not impacted the performance because the motor's gearbox, with a reduction ratio of $30:1$, makes the motor + gearbox + encoder set have an apparent 360 PPR encoder on the output shaft.
As we are only interested in controlling said output shaft, the actual (virtual) encoder resolution is more than enough for a proof-of-concept system.

% Comm
% Limited I/O bytes
% Not using the remote synchronise feature
\subsection{netHAT 52-RTE driver}
Although the other RTE networks supported by the netHAT 52-RTE board should work out-of-the-box with the developed handler, they have not been tested.
Therefore, the current implementation for said handler could be limited to only working with the EtherCAT protocol, which is the only one properly tested.

First of all, EtherCAT includes a remote synchronisation feature that allows the master device to send a \verb|sync| command which will make all slaves update the outputs at the same time.
This feature is supported by the Hilscher's netHAT driver but it has not been included on the developed handler library.
We did not dedicate time to add support for this feature as the designed system would not use it.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that more advanced demonstration concepts would definitely benefit from utilising such feature, especially the ones that would use multiple slave devices simultaneously.
Regardless, the documentation on the netHAT CIFX API states that `Fieldbus synchronization must be supported by the used fieldbus protocol stack.' \cite{nethat:cifx_api_docs}, meaning such feature will only work if the underlying RTE protocol supports it.

One more characteristic that may pose a limitation, mostly on larger and more complex demonstration concepts, is the fixed-size cyclic Input/Output (I/O) data.
As mentioned previously, the netHAT 52-RTE board provides 32 bytes for each input and output cyclic data types.
Although this amount of data is more than sufficient for our proof-of-concept system, it might not be adequate for more advanced case scenarios.

% Encoder (SW)
\subsection{Encoder interface}
By the end of the development phase of this project, the encoder interface used and the driver implemented were very targetted for the specific model we used.
The electrical connection only supports Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) signals up to $3.3V$ and does not support differential signals \cite{technology:diff-signals}, due to the direct connection with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
Although this was the planned way of implementing such interface, one can utilize an external logic processing unit to conver differential signals to absolute ones, which can then replace the current electrical connections.

Furthermore, as the encoder used on our project did not include an Index output (one short pulse every revolution), we did not add support for it on the developed driver.
Effectively, no mechanism for `homing' the absolute position of the motor was implemented, because it was also out of the scope for the current project.
