\section{Limitations} \label{sec:limitations}
In this section we will present the main limitation of the developed system, mainly in the software components.
Most of these limitations exist due to development choices and not due to any particular impediment from realising them.
The main reasons that led us to make such choices include, but are not limited to, the project development being done by a single person, limited development time and, most importantly, the fact that the entire project has been developed from a home environment during the Portuguese COVID-19 lock-downs in early 2021.
