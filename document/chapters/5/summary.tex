\section{Summary}
This chapter has presented the experiment ran and the resulting data that was obtained from it.
An analysis has also been done on the acquired data in order to conclude that the developed system works as expected.
All test cases have been fully described and the conditions under which the experiment was ran have also been presented.
This way, further experiments can compare results with data presented in this document, considering all the differences in hardware and setup conditions.

Furthermore, we have also described the limitations we are aware of after running said experiment.
They all resulted from design choices and can obviously be changed/reimplemented for further study on their effects and/or improve the system as a whole.
