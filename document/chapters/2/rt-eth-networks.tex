\section{Real-time Ethernet networks}\label{sec:rt-networks}

% What are they
As explained in \autoref{sec:context}, real-time \emph{Ethernet} networks have strict timing requirements which makes the usage of common \emph{Ethernet} not adequate.
The IEEE 802.3 standard, as is, does not guarantee a deterministic timing for the delivery of message packets.
As such, a few adaptations of this standard have surfaced over the years, focusing mostly on providing this deterministic delivery of, at least, the message packets that are critical for the system.

% General Characteristics
Commercial \emph{Ethernet} is based upon a 7-layer addressing scheme named \textbf{OSI} (\textbf Open \textbf Systems \textbf Interconnection).
Adaptations such as \emph{Ethernet/IP} or \emph{Profinet/IO} still make use of this 7-layer scheme but manage on which layer message packets are sent, depending on their priority.
On the other hand, implementations such as \emph{EtherCAT} drop most of the \emph{OSI} model and create an entirely new addressing scheme based on the model's second layer.
