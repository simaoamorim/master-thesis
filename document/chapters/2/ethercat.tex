\section{EtherCAT} \label{sec:ethercat}

EtherCAT is a real-time Ethernet network for the industry and was initially developed by Beckhoff Automation \cite{misc:beckhoff}, but it is now under the control of the EtherCAT Technology Group (ETG).
It is described in the IEC61158 standard from the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) and is appropriate for automation solutions requiring real-time capabilities.
The first objectives during development were short cycle times, low communication jitter, precise synchronization and reduced hardware costs \cite{protocol:ethercat}.
