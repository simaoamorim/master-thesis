\section{Summary} \label{sec:sota-summary}

In conclusion, as industrial processes grow in size and complexity, distributing the processing of control actions across several devices has become a wide-spread practice.
Maintaining a cyclic, fast and correct transfer of data between all devices in a control system is a necessity.
For more demanding processes, real-time industrial Ethernet networks have dominated the field due to their high throughput capacity, flexibility in terms of network topologies, deterministic delivery of messages, very high scalability and easy integration with higher-level information systems.
