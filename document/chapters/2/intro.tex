\section{Introduction} \label{sec:sota_intro}

This chapter will present the state of the art of the most relevant concepts and technologies relating to the developed solution.
These are considered essential for the understanding of the base concept and technical aspects of the implementation.

The concepts and technologies explored here are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-time applications - A brief introduction to the concept of time-dependant processes;

	\item Real-time Ethernet networks - An explanation of what these networks are and why they exist;

	\item EtherCAT - A detailed and in-depth presentation of the EtherCAT network, a real-time industrial Ethernet network.
\end{itemize}
