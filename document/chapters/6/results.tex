\section{Experimental results} \label{sec:exp-results}
The experimental results presented in the previous chapter provide solid foundation on which to base our conclusions.

As expected, the experimental data proves that the system developed on this project is capable of producing results with significant performance differences when network cycle times change in control applications.

The acquired data also suggests that concepts exploring more advanced topics can base themselves on the hereby proposed concept in order to expand the possible exploration area.
Interesting results could possibly be obtained by testing synchronisation capabilities with a multi-slave system.
