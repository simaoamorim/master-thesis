\section{Experimental results} \label{sec:exp-results}
The experimental results presented in the previous chapter provide solid foundation on which to base our conclusions.
As expected, the experimental data proves that the concept developed on this project is capable of producing results that represent the effects of network cycle time in control applications.

The acquired data also suggests that concepts exploring more advanced topics can base themselves on the concept proposed here in order to create new systems with a broaden exploration area, possibly even to study cross-effects between the involved topics.
