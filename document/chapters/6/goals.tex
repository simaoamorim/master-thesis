\section{Goals met} \label{sec:goals-met}
After analysing the experimental data gathered in the previous chapter and retrospectively looking back at the original objectives of this project, we can only conclude that all main objectives have successfully been achieved with the terminus of the project.

Some advanced functionality we had planned at the beginning ended up not being implemented, especially improvements addressing mostly user friendliness and ease of use on the software front.
But, as explained in a previous chapter, a proof-of-concept system is not a final product.
All the essential features and desirable characteristics have been implemented, per the project requirements.

The experimental results confirm the validity of the system proposed in this document and provide a good indication that future works based on the presented concept are likely to produce positive results.
Eventually, more advanced designs could be able to port the concept to other scientific domains other than automation engineering.
