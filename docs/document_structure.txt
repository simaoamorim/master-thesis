Introduction
------------


Context
~~~~~~~
 * Describe the situation that prompts us to develop a solution

 There are no practical demonstrators focused on the effects of network cycle time in control
 applications that are also well suited for usage within an educational environment

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~
 * Describe why we want to develop such solution

 the course is planning to introduce a new subject about real-time networks and, as such, having
 a practical demonstrator would be a great booster for the practical lessons

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~
 * What we expect to achieve with this solution

 a demonstrator capable of producing numerical results that provide clear insight on the effects of
 the network cycle time on control applications

Document structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Describe what will be discussed in each chapter of the document

State of the art
----------------

Real-time Ethernet networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EtherCAT
^^^^^^^^
Explain how the EtherCAT network works.

Ethernet/IP
^^^^^^^^^^^
Explain how the Ethernet/IP network works.

Profinet/IO
^^^^^^^^^^^
Explain how the Profinet/IO network works.

[NOTE]
Either present several options or focus on a single one (EtherCAT) and explain it in-depth.

Summary
~~~~~~~
 * Sumarize information given above

System architecture
-------------------

Requirements analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Analysis of what is required to fulfill the objectives.

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

* Computational

 Raspberry Pi

* Motor

 DC Geared motor with incremental quadrature encoder

* Motor control

 DFRobot DFR0592 (PWM + H-Bridge)

* Real-time Ethernet Communication

 Hilscher netHAT 52-RTE

Software
^^^^^^^^
 * Hilscher netHAT API
 * I2C communication with DFR0592 footnote:[SMBus]
 * PID
 * Encoder impulse decoding
 footnote:[Remember that the DFR0592 velocity feedback was too slow to be used (100ms)]

Conceptual experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Explain what types of experiments could be performed using the demonstrator.

Implementation
--------------

Hardware Development

What was actually developped in terms of software, including all the tests created to explore
possible functionalities.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^
What could have been done but wasn't, and what that implies on the results obtained.

TIP: Include functionality tests

Concept and requirements testing
--------------------------------

* Diferences in performance (local vs. remote)
** Velocity control
** Position control

Conclusions
-----------

Experimental results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Summary of results obtained from practical/experimental tests.

Goals met
~~~~~~~~~
Summary of what proposed goals were met.

Final words
~~~~~~~~~~~
Conclude if the solution is actually fit for the intended purpose, based on the previous 2 summaries.

Future work
~~~~~~~~~~~
Explain what can be derived from this solutions.

Code improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Explain what improvements can be made to the current code base.
